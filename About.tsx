            <p>
              TimeFlow was founded in 2023 with a clear mission: to revolutionize how project managers and teams plan, 
              track, and execute their projects. We identified a common pain point in the industryâ€”the time-consuming 
              and often inaccurate process of manual timeline planning.

            <p>
              Our team of AI specialists, project management experts, and software developers came together to create 
              a solution that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to automate and optimize the project 
              planning process.
